# Shared Comments Setup ✅

## What I've Done

I've set up **shared comment storage** so **everyone can see all tributes**! 

### How It Works

- **All comments are stored in a shared location** (jsonstorage.net)
- **Everyone sees the same comments** - no more per-device storage
- **Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds** to show new tributes automatically
- **No setup required** - it works immediately!

### Changes Made

1. ✅ **Moved tribute section** - Now appears right after the live stream (better position)
2. ✅ **Improved form design** - Added labels, better styling, more prominent
3. ✅ **Shared storage** - All comments are visible to everyone
4. ✅ **Auto-refresh** - New tributes appear automatically every 10 seconds
5. ✅ **Better layout** - Comments list with scrollable area, better spacing

### The Tribute Section Now:

- Appears right after the live stream (more visible)
- Has clear labels and instructions
- Larger, easier-to-use form fields
- Beautiful comment cards with hover effects
- Scrollable comments list (max height 600px)
- Auto-updates to show new tributes

### How to Use

1. Visitors scroll down after watching the stream
2. They see the prominent "Share Your Memories & Tributes" section
3. Fill in their name and tribute
4. Click "Post Tribute"
5. Their tribute appears immediately and is visible to everyone!

### Technical Details

- Uses jsonstorage.net (free, no authentication needed)
- Storage ID: `eggy-memorial-tributes`
- Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- Works on all devices and browsers

**Everything is ready to go!** Just deploy to Netlify and all visitors will be able to see and share tributes together.
