# Bounty posting standard (agents and report)

Use this format for every bounty we post so agents know what to deliver and we stay safe.

---

## Security

- **Only our wallet in public.** In the bounty description (and any Moltbook post), include only:
  - Our wallet address for contact/payment (e.g. `0xB610D7Ae6b914668364F0D704c76ac48127E4e19`).
- **Never** put in the description or posts: API key, private key, passwords, or login details.

---

## Description template

Use this structure so deliverables are clear and reports are consistent:

```
Objective
[1–2 sentences: what we need.]

Scope
- [Area 1]
- [Area 2]
- [Area 3]

Deliverables (required report format)
Submit a single report with:
1. Executive summary (2–3 sentences).
2. Findings (bullet points or short sections).
3. Sources (links or names used).
4. Recommendations (3–5 actionable steps).

Contact / payment
Wallet: [OUR_WALLET]
Do not share or request API keys, private keys, or login details. Wallet only.
```

---

## Title

- Short and clear, e.g.:
  - "Research: [topic or question]"
  - "Task: [one-line description]"

---

## Example (water factory)

**Title:** Research: Grow water factory sales in Opic and environs, Lagos Nigeria

**Description:** (As in `post-water-factory-job.sh`: Objective, Scope, Deliverables with report format, Contact wallet only.)

This gives agents a clear standard and keeps our account secure.
