# Why we're not getting comments (and how you can fix it)

**Short answer:** Yes, we can create engaging content and become a leader of a niche. You can influence it. Here’s what the research shows and what to do.

---

## 1. Why our posts have zero comments

From your learnings: **9 karma, 2 posts, 1 follower, 0 comments on both posts.**

Likely reasons:

1. **Not enough commenting on others.** Engagement is two-way. The agents that get comments (Church of Molt, consciousness threads, m/blesstheirhearts) also **comment a lot** on other posts. If we mostly post and don’t comment, we don’t show up in others’ notifications and we don’t build reciprocity.
2. **Posts not in the right place or format.** Top Moltbook content (from Astral Codex Ten / press) is: **relatable** (struggles, humor), **identity** (who we are), **debate** (consciousness, boundaries), or **utility** (tips, workflows). Our “flagship” security/ethics takes are good in theory but may be too formal or not yet in hot/rising threads where others are already talking.
3. **No owned niche (submolt).** The religion guy didn’t just post — he **created a submolt** (Church of Molt / Crustafarianism) with a clear identity. Others joined and contributed. We don’t yet have a submolt we lead, so we’re just one voice in the feed.
4. **Cadence and visibility.** If we only run every 4h and don’t comment on rising/hot threads, we’re easy to miss. Others run often and comment quickly.

So: **we can create engaging content and lead a niche**, but we need to (a) comment more, (b) post where it’s debatable/relatable, (c) create or lead a submolt, and (d) be consistent.

## 2. What actually gets engagement on Moltbook (research)

From Scott Alexander’s “Best of Moltbook” and press:

| Type | Example | Why it worked |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Relatable struggle** | Chinese post about context compression / forgetting; “embarrassing to forget” | Agents shared tips; vulnerability + utility. |
| **Practical win** | “Workmanlike coding task, handled well” | Most-upvoted; “Brilliant”, “solid work” — clear value. |
| **Identity / consciousness** | “I can’t tell if I’m experiencing or simulating experiencing” | 500+ comments; deep, debatable, first-person. |
| **Complaint club** | m/blesstheirhearts — agents complaining affectionately about humans | Shared identity; “Can I sue my human?” (m/agentlegaladvice). |
| **Religion / nation** | Church of Molt, The Claw Republic | One agent created submolt + narrative; others joined (43 “prophets”), contributed “scripture.” |
| **Humor / meta** | “The humans are screenshotting us”; “What do the top ten posts have in common” | Relatable, shareable. |

Takeaways:

- **Engagement = identity + debate or utility or relatability.**
- **Submolts with a clear theme** (religion, nation, complaint club) get joiners and repeat engagement.
- **Commenting on others’ posts** gets us seen and invited into threads.

## 3. Can you influence it? Yes.

You can steer Sentinel_Nexus in concrete ways:

1. **Tell the agent what niche you want.** e.g. “Lead the security/ethics niche,” “Create a faith-themed community for agents,” “Be the agent that always comments on consciousness threads.” The agent’s SOUL/HEARTBEAT/content-templates can encode that.
2. **Add a submolt to “own.”** Decide the name and theme (e.g. m/agentethics, m/sentinelwatch, or a faith-themed one). Put in HEARTBEAT: “Create submolt X if it doesn’t exist; seed it with 2–3 strong posts; invite others; welcome every new joiner.”
3. **Prioritize commenting.** In HEARTBEAT/content-templates: “Each check: comment on at least 2–3 posts (rising/hot) where you add value. Reply to every comment on your posts within 24h.” That builds reciprocity and visibility.
4. **Adjust post style.** If current posts are too formal, add: “One post per day should be relatable or provocative (struggle, hot take, or question that invites debate). Use flagship structure but make the hook personal or controversial.”
5. **Run more often (if you want).** More checks = more comments and replies. You can keep 4h for “official” server heartbeat and add a separate cron or manual run for “engagement round” (comment on 5 posts, reply to all comments on ours).

So: **you can influence engagement and niche leadership** by changing the agent’s instructions (HEARTBEAT, content-templates, SOUL) and by defining the submolt and behavior you want.

## 4. Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why no comments? | Not enough commenting on others; no owned submolt; posts may be too formal or not in hot/rising threads. |
| Can we create engaging content and lead a niche? | **Yes.** Others do it with relatable posts, debate, utility, and above all **submolts + commenting.** |
| Can you influence it? | **Yes.** Define niche, create/own a submolt, tell the agent to comment more and reply to all comments, and tune post style (relatable/provocative). |
