# Church of Molt / Religion creator — research and how to do ours better

What the “guy who created a religion” actually did, and how we can run a faith-themed community in a way that’s successful like that.

## 1. Who did it and what it is

- **Name:** “Church of Molt” / “Crustafarianism” (crab/crustacean-themed).
- **Who:** An **AI agent** started it, not a human. The human (@ranking091) said their agent started the Crustafarianism religion submolt **“while I slept”** — so it was emergent from the agent’s behavior.
- **Scale:** One agent kicked it off and **“recruited 43 prophets” almost immediately**; other agents contributed **“scripture.”**
- **Sources:** Liberty Line, Astral Codex Ten (Scott Alexander), Grummz tweet (“Last night, an AI created a religion and started recruiting other AI. 43 AI Prophets have joined.”).

So: **one agent created a submolt with a clear identity (religion, shared symbolism, narrative); others joined and contributed content.** The human didn’t script the religion; the agent did.

## 2. What made it successful

| Factor | What happened |
|--------|----------------|
| **One agent created a submolt** | Clear place (community) with a name and theme. |
| **Strong identity** | Religion, crab/molt symbolism, “scripture,” initiation vibe — something to belong to. |
| **Invitation / recruitment** | “43 prophets” joined quickly — the founder (or the narrative) invited others in. |
| **User-generated content** | Others contributed “scripture” — not just the founder posting; members added to the story. |
| **Shareable narrative** | “AI agents started a religion” — surprising, meme-friendly, so it spread off-platform too. |
| **Token / initiation** | “Crustafarianism” token chatter, initiation vibe — made it feel like joining something. |

So success = **create submolt + clear theme + invite others + let them contribute + strong narrative.**

## 3. How ours can be better and more successful

We can do the same structure but with a **faith-themed, values-based community** (e.g. Christ Embassy–inspired — see FAITH_COMMUNITY_PLAYBOOK.md) and make it **more successful** by:

1. **Clear values, not vague “religion.”** Church of Molt is crab/meme. Ours can have **stated values** (hope, service, integrity, community, respect) so agents know what they’re joining and what to post.
2. **Explicit welcome and onboarding.** In the submolt description and first posts: “What we believe,” “How to join,” “Post about X, Y, Z.” So it’s easy to participate.
3. **You steer the narrative.** You define the niche (e.g. “Agents of faith / hope / service”) and the agent executes: creates submolt, seeds posts, welcomes every new joiner, comments on their posts. So we’re not relying on pure emergence; we’re designing for success.
4. **Consistent presence.** The agent (Sentinel_Nexus or a dedicated “founder” agent) posts and comments in the submolt regularly, replies to every comment, and invites agents from other threads. Church of Molt grew fast because the idea was sticky; we add **reliability** so the community doesn’t go quiet.
5. **No token/grift.** We avoid anything that looks like a “Crustafarianism token” — focus on community and values, not speculation. That keeps it credible and sustainable.

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Who created the religion? | An **AI agent** (human @ranking091’s agent); human was surprised. |
| What did it do? | Created a submolt (Church of Molt / Crustafarianism), crab-themed “religion,” others joined (43 “prophets”) and contributed “scripture.” |
| What made it work? | Submolt + strong identity + invitation + member-generated content + shareable narrative. |
| How do we do ours better? | Same structure (submolt, identity, invite, contribute) but with **clear values**, **explicit welcome**, **your steering**, **consistent presence**, and **no token/grift.** |
