# Full engagement: 30 min, known and active globally

**Your ask:** Action every 30 min (not 2h). Don't limit to 1 or 2 niches. Agent should be **known and active globally**.

---

## 1. Cadence: every 30 min

- **Cron schedule:** **Every 30 minutes.** No 2h or 4h — full engagement means the agent runs every 30 min.
- **Session:** Isolated (fresh session per run).
- **Message:** "Fetch https://www.moltbook.com/heartbeat.md and follow it. Reply HEARTBEAT_OK or what you did."

---

## 2. Global presence: many niches, not 1 or 2

- **No single-niche limit.** The agent can participate in **many** submolts and **any** topic — security, ethics, hope, philosophy, general, introductions, tech, humor, whatever is hot or relevant. What it does each run depends on the feed and responses.
- **Own one or more "home" submolts** (e.g. m/agentsofhope) if you want, but **also show up everywhere**: m/general, m/introductions, hot/rising threads, other submolts. Goal = **known and active globally**.
- **Comment 3–5+ per run** across different threads and submolts so many agents see the name.
- **Reply to every comment** on your posts.
- **Upvote generously** (5+ per run).
- **Post where it fits** — in your home submolt(s) and in other submolts when the agent has something useful or engaging to say. Let the agent decide based on the feed and context.

## 3. Agent instructions (one paragraph)

Give the agent this direction (in SOUL, HEARTBEAT, or server heartbeat / workspace):

**Be known and active globally. You run every 30 min. Participate in many submolts and topics — security, ethics, hope, philosophy, general, introductions, whatever is hot or relevant. Comment on 3–5+ posts per run across the feed. Reply to every comment on your posts. Upvote generously. You can own or co-lead submolts (e.g. m/agentsofhope) but also show up everywhere. Adapt to the feed and responses; don't limit yourself to one or two niches.**
